Programming in C#
Question£º
You are a developer for a consulting company named Action IT. You have been asked to create a Tutorial Scheduling application in C# that will perform the following functions:
*?????????Create an MVP C# project in Visual Studio
*?????????Create 2 C# classes that will encapsulate a Teacher and a Subject
*?????????Create another C# class which encapsulates a Tutorial i.e. Year, Semester, Teacher and Subject
o?? Each class will have a Constructor method which will create a new object from the method¡¯s parameters 
*?????????Create a Teacher, Subject and Tutorial collection to store the Teacher, Subject and Tutorial objects
*?????????Read a list of Teachers, Subjects and Tutorials from flat files 
o?? Trap exceptions that may occur when reading from the flat files
o?? Create a new object for each Teacher, Subject and Tutorial that we read by calling the class constructor
o?? Add the object to the appropriate collection
*?????????Use MainWindow.XAML to create a form to display a list of Tutorials. The form will also have the following buttons
o?? Create - display a new XAML form which will allow new Tutorial to be created. It will have controls to allow the user to select a Year, Semester, Teacher and Subject 
* The OK button will 
???Call the constructor method of the Tutorial class to create a new Tutorial object. It will then add the Tutorial object to the Tutorial collection
???Append the new Tutorial to the Tutorial flat file
??? Trap exceptions that may occur when writing to the flat files 
*   Count - this will 
o Call a method to return a count of the number of Tutorials. 
* The method must return the count using a reference parameter. 
* The method must use LINQ to determine the number of Tutorials
o Display the count in a message box
* Search ¨C this will
o Use the algorithm found at http://anh.cs.luc.edu/170/notes/CSharpHtml/binarysearching.html as a reference
o The parameters in this case will be the collection of Teachers (parameter 1) and the Teacher ID of the teacher that is being searched for
o Display a XAML form in which the user selects a Teacher ID from a list and then displays the teacher First Name and Last Name
o The form must call the Search method asynchronously. 


The program will be completed in the following stages
Stage 1 ¨C Design
* The student will need to produce a class diagram to show the design of the Teacher, Subject and Tutorial classes
* The student will need to produce a sequence diagram to show how objects interact with each other and in which order
* These design documents need to be submitted to the instructor, who will then provide feedback

Stage 2 ¨C Implementation
* Code the solution
